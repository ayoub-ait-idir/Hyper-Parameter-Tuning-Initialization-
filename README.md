# Hyper-Parameter-Tuning-
This Notebook illustrates how hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimisation can help improving the performance of our model.
The first notebook is about the difference between different approches of parameter initialization used in Deep Neural Networks. Initialization with zeros, random initialization and what's called ''He initialization'', and shows the performance of each initialization.
